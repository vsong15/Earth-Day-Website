	<h3>What is Earth Day?</h3>
						<p>
              The origin of Earth Day begins in 1970 and has grown to be recognized as an international holiday celebrated by millions of people. Due to the growing evidence of the dangers of environmental destruction from pollution and inspiration from protests done by student organizations during the Vietnam War, Earth Day came to be from a man named Gaylord Nelson, a Wisconsin Senator who was driven to teach people how to take care of our planet. As you read through this timeline of events, you will be inspired yourself to make a difference in our world.
